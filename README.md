# Air-canvas
Air Canvas is an innovative project leveraging real-time hand tracking technology to create a unique and intuitive drawing experience. The system detects the user's index finger in real-time, allowing them to draw directly on the screen using hand gestures. This project merges computer vision, offering a novel way to interact with digital content.

# How to Use:

* Use your index and middle finger to activate Selection Mode and choose from various colors or the eraser at the top of the screen.

* Enter in Stand by Mode using only your index and pinky finger (indicated by a line between these 2 fingers). This mode is useful when you want to draw separate things on the screen.
